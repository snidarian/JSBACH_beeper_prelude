# JSBACH_beeper_prelude
Raspi beeper playing Js Bach's Prelude in C major



Wire a beeper to (BOARD) pin 16 and listen to the past and future clash melodically. I'm overselling it ;D



Really fun project that demonstrates another cool things that you can do with PWD (Pulse Width Modulation)

The same way that you can use PWM to make lights appear brighter of softer, you can use Hz to make a beeper produce higher or lower tones. The beeper I used is not very high quality and a higher quality beeper will render much better music. Here you go! if you feel driven you can improve upon what I've done with my saturday if you like!


I'll include all the code that I used for this project
